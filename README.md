# Quiz Competition App

I developed this project to reinforce the concepts of react hooks, to send API requests, to format the responses from the API and show them in the user interface, and to send props while controlling the transitions between pages using the react-router v6 version. The goal of the project.

The project is a quiz simulator. When we click the start button on the homepage, it directs us to the exam screen. It sets a time limit of 30 seconds for each question on the exam screen. The first 10 seconds prevent answering questions. It is not possible to move forward or backward between questions. At the end of 30 seconds, the next question is passed. If you cannot answer the question, it moves on to the next question. After a total of 10 questions are completed, it automatically redirects to the result screen. On the results screen, you can see the questions and the results you gave to the questions. You will also see the questions you left blank as unanswered.

## Technologies and Concepts

- **React**: I used it to render the UI.
- **Tailwind CSS**: I chose it for fast and efficient styling.
- **Component Based Design**: I aimed to create page components in a modular way.
- **Project Structure and Organization**: I tried to keep the file and folder structure organized and clear.
